Project Overview: Car Workshop Finder with OBD-II Diagnostics
Objective:
The Car Workshop Finder app is designed to help users easily locate nearby car workshops and obtain real-time diagnostic data from their vehicle’s OBD-II system. By combining location-based search with OBD-II diagnostics, this app offers a comprehensive solution for vehicle owners to manage maintenance needs and monitor vehicle health in one place.
Features:
1.	Workshop Finder:
o	Users can find nearby car workshops based on location.
o	Each workshop profile includes the name, location, services offered, and contact information.
2.	OBD-II Diagnostics:
o	Integrates OBD-II support to display real-time data like engine RPM, vehicle speed, and fuel level.
o	Provides Bluetooth-based OBD-II data retrieval and displays it within the app’s diagnostics section.
3.	Cross-Platform Compatibility:
o	Built using React Native and Expo to run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
Key Technologies:
•	React Native and Expo for mobile application development.
•	Bluetooth permissions and location services for accessing vehicle data and finding nearby workshops.
•	OBD-II Protocol using react-native-obd2 library to interact with OBD-II devices.
 
Software Requirements
To set up and run the app, the following software and tools are required:
1. Development Environment
•	Node.js: Version 16 or 18 (LTS recommended)
•	npm: Comes with Node.js and is required to manage dependencies.
•	Expo CLI: Expo's command-line tool for running and managing Expo projects.
bash
Copy code
npm install -g expo-cli
•	React Native CLI (Optional): For more control over the native development workflow.
bash
Copy code
npm install -g react-native-cli
2. Libraries and Dependencies
•	Expo SDK: For simplified cross-platform development.
•	react-native-obd2: Library for OBD-II Bluetooth integration.
•	metro and metro-config: Metro bundler is required to bundle the JavaScript code for React Native projects.
3. Mobile Device Requirements
•	OBD-II Bluetooth Adapter: The app requires a Bluetooth-enabled OBD-II adapter compatible with the vehicle.
•	Android/iOS Device: To test the app, you’ll need a real device, as OBD-II functionality and Bluetooth permissions cannot be fully tested on emulators.
4. Platform-Specific Configurations
•	Android:
o	Permissions in AndroidManifest.xml for Bluetooth and location access.
•	iOS:
o	Permissions in Info.plist for Bluetooth and location access, such as NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription and NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription.
5. Running the App
After installing the dependencies and setting up permissions, use the following commands to run the app:
bash
Copy code
// Start Expo CLI
expo starts
Then, connect a real device with the Expo Go app (for testing) or run it on a simulator for non-Bluetooth features.
